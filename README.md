## What it does:
Basically, you just enter some letters and it finds all the words that can be spelled with the letters.
There are also other ways it can find words. These include:
- Cutting mode. This mode simply finds words within a string, without moving letters around. For example, "chungus" will return words like "hung" and "us".
- Swapping mode. This mode just finds words that can be made by moving around letters in a string. For example, "tsrhae" will return "haters", "hearts" and "earths".
## How to install:
1. First, run `git clone https://github.com/YeemBoi/pyWordFinder` in Linux terminal
2. Optional: to remove the .git folder, run `rm -rf !$/.git`
3. Run "setupWordFinder.py" with `python3`
4. Done! Just run the new batch file to use the word finder
### Dictionaries:
PyWordFinder requires a separate file as a dictionary. My suggestions include:<br>
[Mielestronk's "Corncob" list of words with British spelling](http://www.mieliestronk.com/corncob_caps.txt)<br>
[jonbcard's scrabble-bot dictionary](https://github.com/jonbcard/scrabble-bot/blob/master/src/dictionary.txt)
