## What it does:
Basically, you just enter some letters and it finds all the words that can be spelled with the letters.
## How to install:
1. In Linux terminal, run `git clone https://github.com/YeemBoi/pyWordFinder`
2. Run "setupWordFinder.py" with `python3`
3. Done! Just run the new batch file to use the word finder
### Dictionaries:
PyWordFinder requires a separate file as a dictionary. My suggestions include:<br>
Mielestronk's "Corncob" list of words (with British spelling) at http://www.mieliestronk.com/corncob_caps.txt<br>
jonbcard's scrabble-bot dictionary at https://github.com/jonbcard/scrabble-bot/blob/master/src/dictionary.txt
